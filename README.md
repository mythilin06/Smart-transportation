# Smart-transportation
A Python-based Smart Transport System that helps users find the best routes between cities in Andhra Pradesh & Telangana using Dijkstra’s Algorithm. The system factors in real-time traffic and weather conditions to provide accurate travel time and cost estimates.
##About the Project
The Smart Transportation System is a GUI-based application that allows users to:
Select a starting point and a destination.
Choose a mode of transport (Car, Bike, Bus).
Calculate the best possible route using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
Factor in real-time traffic & weather conditions to adjust travel time.
Display results including distance, estimated time, and cost.
Open the selected route in Google Maps for navigation.
This project helps travelers, commuters, and transport planners optimize their journeys efficiently.
##Features
✔ Shortest Path Calculation - Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm for optimized routing.
✔ Real-Time Traffic & Weather Simulation - Adjusts travel time dynamically.
✔ Multiple Transport Modes - Supports Car, Bike, and Bus with different speeds.
✔ Google Maps Integration - Opens the route directly in Google Maps.
✔ Recent Searches - Stores the last three searches for quick access.
✔ User-Friendly GUI - Built using Tkinter for easy navigation.
